# Machine Learning App - State Management Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the machine-learning app with comprehensive state management for training sessions, allowing users to navigate backwards and forwards through the wizard while preserving state and handling training setting changes properly.

## New Features

### 1. Training Session State Tracking
- **`lastTrainingSettings`**: Stores the settings used for the last successful training
- **`hasUnsavedChanges`**: Tracks when current settings differ from last trained settings
- **`getCurrentTrainingSettings()`**: Creates a snapshot of current training configuration
- **`hasTrainingSettingsChanged()`**: Compares current settings with last trained settings

### 2. Smart Model Invalidation
- Automatically invalidates trained model when training settings change:
  - Model type changes
  - Target column changes
  - Feature column selection changes
  - Training split ratio changes
  - Clustering method or number of clusters changes
- Model remains valid for navigation until settings actually change

### 3. Visual Status Indicators
- **Success Status**: Green banner showing "Model trained successfully with current settings"
- **Warning Status**: Orange banner indicating "Training settings have changed. Model needs to be retrained"
- **Settings History**: Expandable details showing what settings were used for last training

### 4. Enhanced Navigation
- **Intelligent Tab Access**: Allow navigation to previously completed tabs even if current model is invalidated
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Warn users when navigating away from training settings with unsaved changes
- **State Preservation**: Maintain all wizard state when navigating backwards and forwards

### 5. Retrain Capability
- **Retrain Button**: Appears in Training Process tab when settings have changed
- **Seamless Retraining**: Use updated settings without losing navigation progress
- **Status Updates**: Clear warnings after successful retraining

### 6. Robust Reset Handling
- **Complete State Reset**: "Train Another Model" clears all training session state
- **Fresh Start**: Ensures clean slate for new training sessions
- **UI Cleanup**: Removes status messages, retrain buttons, and resets all inputs

## User Workflow Examples

### Scenario 1: Basic Training and Navigation
1. Upload data → Configure settings → Train model → View results
2. Navigate back to any previous tab - state preserved
3. Navigate forward to results/test tabs - previous training results available

### Scenario 2: Settings Change and Retrain
1. Complete initial training workflow
2. Return to Training Settings tab
3. Change target column or features
4. Warning appears: "Training settings have changed. Model needs to be retrained"
5. Go to Training Process tab - "Retrain Model" button appears
6. Click "Retrain Model" - trains with new settings
7. Warning disappears, success message shows

### Scenario 3: Data Upload Reset
1. Complete training with Dataset A
2. Upload new Dataset B on Model & Data tab
3. All training state automatically reset (model invalidated)
4. Configure new settings for Dataset B
5. Train fresh model with new data

## Technical Implementation

### State Management Functions
```javascript
getCurrentTrainingSettings()    // Snapshot current config
hasTrainingSettingsChanged()   // Compare with baseline
saveCurrentTrainingSettings()  // Save successful training baseline
markSettingsChanged()         // Mark when changes detected
invalidateTrainedModel()      // Clear model when settings change
updateTrainingStatus()        // Update UI status indicators
```

### Event Tracking
- All training setting controls monitored for changes
- Automatic model invalidation on relevant changes
- Status updates on tab navigation
- Change detection integrated with existing validation

### UI Components
- Dynamic status message container
- Retrain button creation and management
- Tab navigation permissions
- Confirmation dialogs for unsaved changes

## Benefits

1. **Intuitive User Experience**: Users can explore the wizard freely without losing progress
2. **Clear Communication**: Always know when retraining is needed and why
3. **Flexible Workflow**: Support both linear progression and iterative refinement
4. **Data Integrity**: Prevent confusion about which settings were used for results
5. **Error Prevention**: Avoid displaying results from outdated model configurations

## Testing

Use the included `test-state-management.html` file and `sample-data.csv` for comprehensive testing of all state management scenarios.

## Browser Compatibility

Compatible with all modern browsers that support ES6+ features. No external dependencies added for state management functionality.
