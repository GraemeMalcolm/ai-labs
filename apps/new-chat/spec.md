This is a specification for a web chat app. The app should be a HTML 5 web site with a single HTML file supported by a single JavaScript file for code and a single CSS file for visual themes.

The app should use NLP.js to extract key terms from the user's input, and then search Wikipedia using those keywords to return the first relevant article. The app should then use NLP.js to summarize the first paragraph of the article and respond to the user with the summary.

When responding, the message typing should be animated word by word.
