## What Is Text Analysis?

Text analysis refers to the computational techniques used to extract structure, meaning, and insights from unstructured text. It’s the backbone of modern NLP and powers applications like search engines, chatbots, recommendation systems, and legal discovery tools.

**Why It Matters**

- Volume: Text data is everywhere—emails, reviews, articles, transcripts.
- Unstructured Nature: Unlike databases, text lacks predefined schema.
- Human Language Complexity: Ambiguity, idioms, sarcasm, and context make it hard to parse.

## Key Concepts in Text Analysis

- Tokenization: Splitting text into words, phrases, or subword units.
- Normalization: Lowercasing, removing punctuation, standardizing formats.
- Noise Reduction: Removing irrelevant content (e.g., HTML tags, boilerplate).
