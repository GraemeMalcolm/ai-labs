- RAKE: Uses word co-occurrence and frequency.
- TextRank: Graph-based ranking of phrases.
- Transformers: Use attention weights to identify salient tokens.

## Named Entity Recognition (NER)

- Detects entities like people, organizations, locations, dates.
- Models: spaCy, BERT-based NER, Flair.

## Summarization

- Extractive: Selects key sentences (TextRank, LexRank).
- Abstractive: Generates new text (BART, T5).

## Text Classification

- Assigns labels (e.g., spam, topic, sentiment).
- Commonly used for sentiment analysis
- Models: Naive Bayes, SVM, BERT fine-tuning.
