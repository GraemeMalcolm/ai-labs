# Statistical Roots of NLP

Before deep learning, NLP relied on symbolic and statistical methods. These techniques are still useful for interpretable models and resource-constrained environments.

## Core Techniques in Text Analysis

- Term Frequency (TF): Simple word count per document.
- Stop-word Removal: Eliminates high-frequency, low-value words.
- Stemming: Heuristic-based truncation (e.g., Porter Stemmer).
- Lemmatization: Dictionary-based reduction using POS tags.
- TF-IDF: Combines term frequency with inverse document frequency to highlight distinctive words.
- Parts-of-Speech (POS) Tagging: Assigns grammatical roles using rule-based or statistical models.
